# SG-Food-List
Repo to journal down all the good food I find in Singapore with structured reviews

# To Do List
Creation of Main folder, each restaurant should have a file which includes:
1. Details: Description / Signature Dish / Location Type / Address / Opening Hours
2. Review: Taste / Service / Environment / Plating? / Value for Money / TBC other criteria
3. Tags: Dates / Family / Solo / Friends / Long Chat / Large Gathering (>6)

Future Enhancement
1. Some way to integrate with map?
2. Standardise review methodology as much as possible, potential review by AI?
3. AI Summary of Google Review?
